OpenWiki ships seven built-in connectors that pull external data into a local raw cache under `~/.openwiki/connectors/<id>/raw/`, which the documentation agent then reads and synthesizes into wiki pages (mainly for personal/local-wiki mode; `git-repo` also matters for code mode when documenting a different target repo than the one being ingested from).

## Connector architecture

All connectors share types in `src/connectors/types.ts`:

- `ConnectorId` — the union of implemented connector ids: `"git-repo" | "google" | "hackernews" | "notion" | "slack" | "web-search" | "x"`. This union is ground truth for what exists today.
- `ConnectorBackend` — `"direct-api" | "local-git" | "mcp-http" | "mcp-stdio"`.
- `ConnectorDefinition` / `ConnectorRuntime` — id, display name, description, required env var names, whether the connector supports agentic discovery (letting the agent decide what to fetch) vs. deterministic ingestion, and an `ingest()` function.
- `ConnectorIngestResult` — `{ status: "success" | "skipped" | "error", rawFiles, warnings, runId, statePath, message }`.
- `ConnectorState` — per-connector cursor/dedup bookkeeping (`lastRunAt`, `latestIds`, last 20 `runs`) persisted at `~/.openwiki/connectors/<id>/state.json`.

`src/connectors/registry.ts` (`createConnectorRegistry()`) wires up all seven; `notion` is built through the generic `createMcpConnector()` factory (`src/connectors/sources/mcp.ts`) rather than a bespoke source file.

Shared IO helpers live in `src/connectors/io.ts`: `writeRawJson()` writes raw dumps with `0600`/`0700` permissions under `~/.openwiki/connectors/<id>/raw/<runId>/`, and `updateStateWithRun()` maintains the state file.

All direct-API connectors (Gmail, Slack, X, Hacker News) and the HTTP MCP client route their network calls through `fetchWithResilience` in `src/connectors/http.ts`. This wrapper adds a per-request wall-clock timeout (default 30s; 60s for the HTTP MCP client to match the stdio client), bounded exponential backoff with full jitter on 429 and 5xx responses, and the same backoff on network errors (connection reset, DNS, timeout). It honors a numeric or HTTP-date `Retry-After` header when present. Auth failures (401/403) and other 4xx are returned unchanged and never retried, so Gmail's existing 401 → token-refresh → retry path still sees the 401 and accounts can't be locked by retry storms. The sleep function and jitter RNG are injectable so tests run instantly and deterministically.

Agent-facing tools (`src/connectors/tools.ts`) expose this to the LLM during a run: `openwiki_list_connectors`, `openwiki_list_mcp_tools`, `openwiki_call_mcp_tool`, `openwiki_ingest_connector`, `openwiki_ingest_all_connectors`, `openwiki_list_raw_items`, `openwiki_read_raw_item`. Raw-file reads are sandboxed to stay inside each connector's `raw/` directory, and required-env status is reported as booleans only — secret values are never surfaced to the model.

## MCP subsystem

`src/connectors/mcp-client.ts` is a low-level JSON-RPC MCP client (stdio or HTTP transport) implementing `listMcpTools`/`executeMcpTool`/`executeMcpReadOnlyOperations`. `src/connectors/mcp-runtime.ts` wraps it for connector use (currently only `notion`), adding a **read-only tool-call policy**: a tool call is allowed only if it's explicitly listed in `allowedTools`, the MCP server's own `readOnlyHint` annotation is `true`, or (for the hosted `mcp.notion.com/mcp` endpoint specifically) the tool name/description matches a read-only heuristic (search/retrieve/get/list/query/read/fetch/find/lookup/load/children). This is the mechanism that keeps MCP-backed connectors read-only even though the underlying server may expose write tools.

### Notable per-connector behavior

- **Slack and "latest message" questions**: `my-recent-messages.json` includes a `definitiveForLatestMessage` flag. It is `true` only when the latest message was resolved via `search.messages` (requires the `search:read` user-token scope). If that search is unavailable, the connector falls back to a bounded `conversations.history` scan, sets `definitiveForLatestMessage: false`, and warns that the result is not reliably the user's true latest Slack message. Always check this flag before answering "what did I last say on Slack" from raw Slack data.
- **X streams and cursors**: each stream (except `bookmarks`) tracks a `since_id` cursor in connector state so repeated ingestion runs are incremental; `list_posts` fans out per configured `listIds`.
- **Notion is disabled until configured**: `enabled: true` plus a transport must be set in connector config before ingestion does anything beyond tool discovery.
- **git-repo has no ingest-vs-agent distinction for read access**: it's the only connector marked `supportsAgenticDiscovery: true` alongside `notion`, since a git checkout can be explored freely rather than pulled through a bounded API.

## Ingestion orchestration

`src/ingestion.ts` (`runOpenWikiIngestion`) loads `~/.openwiki/.env`, reads onboarding config, builds the connector registry, and resolves a target — `"all"`, a bare `ConnectorId`, or a specific source instance id (connectors can be configured more than once, e.g. `web-search-1`/`web-search-2`, run individually via `openwiki ingest web-search-2`). For each matched instance it runs deterministic ingestion first (writing raw JSON + updating state), then the synthesis agent run reads those raw files to update the wiki. This split — deterministic fetch, then LLM synthesis — keeps credentialed network calls out of model-controlled code paths.

## Onboarding and scheduling

`src/onboarding.ts` drives first-run setup: wiki template selection, scope customization, per-source ingestion notes, and source schedules, persisted to `~/.openwiki/onboarding.json`. Global personal-wiki instructions are saved to `~/.openwiki/INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

`src/schedules.ts` installs source schedules as macOS user LaunchAgents (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/`) with logs under `~/.openwiki/logs/`, and backs the `openwiki cron list|pause|resume|delete` commands (see [CLI usage](/cli/usage.md)).

## Things to watch when changing connector behavior

- Adding a connector means: extend `ConnectorId` in `types.ts`, add a source file under `src/connectors/sources/`, register it in `registry.ts`, and add its `SOURCE_OPTIONS` entry in `src/credentials.tsx` onboarding — see `/skills/write-connector/SKILL.md` for the full checklist.
- Never write secret values into connector config or raw dumps — only env var names and presence booleans.
- Keep deterministic ingestion (network calls) out of agent-controlled code; the agent only reads what ingestion already wrote to `raw/`.
- MCP connectors must stay read-only; changes to `mcp-runtime.ts`'s tool-call policy directly affect what a hosted MCP server is allowed to do on OpenWiki's behalf.
